                The Dodge Tomahawk is a concept motorcycle unveiled in 2003,
                known for its futuristic design and extreme performance. It
                features an 8.3-liter V10 engine from the Dodge Viper, producing
                around 500 horsepower. With a unique four-wheel design (two
                front and two rear wheels), it was engineered more as a
                showpiece than a street-legal vehicle. The Tomahawk is capable
                of reaching theoretical speeds over 300 mph, making it one of
                the most powerful and visually striking motorcycles ever
                created.

                The Electrom LEV (Light Electric Vehicle) Motorcycle is a
                streamlined, pedal-assisted electric motorcycle designed for
                high-efficiency urban and long-distance travel. Featuring a
                recumbent riding position, enclosed bodywork, and a robust
                electric drivetrain, it combines the speed and power of a
                motorcycle with the efficiency and comfort of an e-bike. With a
                top speed of around 100 km/h (62 mph) and a range exceeding 200
                km (124 miles), the Electrom LEV offers a unique alternative to

                Honda Riding Assist is an advanced self-balancing technology
                designed for motorcycles, using robotics-derived systems rather
                than traditional gyroscopes. The system utilizes a steer-by-wire
                mechanism to electronically control the angle of the front fork
                and subtly adjust the front wheel’s direction, maintaining
                balance without rider input. This system is based on
                technologies from Honda’s UNI-CUB mobility device and ASIMO
                robot. The Riding Assist technology allows the motorcycle to
                stay upright at low speeds and when stationary. It also features
                the ability to autonomously follow the rider at walking speed.
                This reduces the risk of tipping over, making it ideal for
                novice riders, those with shorter stature, or when navigating
                tight spaces.

                car, it became an innovative solution for urban mobility.
                Powered by a 49cc two-stroke engine, it could reach a top speed
                of around 30 mph (48 km/h). Its small size, lightweight frame,
                and folding design made it a perfect companion for city dwellers
                looking for an easy and efficient way to navigate through

                The Honda ATC 250R is a three-wheeled all-terrain vehicle (ATV)
                produced from 1981 to 1986, specifically designed for
                high-performance off-road riding. It is powered by a 246cc,
                air-cooled, two-stroke single-cylinder engine, delivering strong
                performance with a 6-speed manual transmission and a chain final
                drive. The engine utilizes a reed valve system for improved fuel
                efficiency and power delivery. The ATC 250R features a
                single-shock rear suspension with a long-travel, independent
                front suspension (leading-axle design), allowing it to handle
                rough terrains with better stability and comfort. This model is
                known for its agile handling, thanks to a combination of a short
                wheelbase, low center of gravity, and strong performance.

                The Honda Koraidon is a life-sized concept motorcycle inspired
                by the legendary Pokémon Koraidon from *Pokémon Scarlet*.
                Standing 2.5 meters tall and weighing 303 kg, it features
                cutting-edge technology, including Honda’s Riding Assist system,
                which allows it to balance itself and transition between two
                modes: a "Sprinting Build" that mimics Koraidon’s running
                posture and a "Walking Build" with four-legged movement. The
                bike is also equipped with animated eyes, facial expressions,
                and limb movements that change with speed, giving it a lifelike
                appearance. The Honda Koraidon showcases Honda’s innovative
                approach to merging mobility with Pokémon fandom, making its
                debut in 2025.

                The BMW C1 is a unique scooter-style motorcycle produced by BMW
                from 2000 to 2003. It features a fully enclosed cabin with a
                built-in safety roll cage, seatbelts, and a helmet, offering
                protection similar to that of a car. This innovative design
                aimed to provide a safer and more comfortable riding experience
                in urban environments. Powered by a 125cc or 200cc engine, the
                C1 was designed for city commuting, offering excellent fuel
                efficiency and easy handling. Although it was ahead of its time,
                the C1 was discontinued due to limited market appeal and high
                production costs.

                ​The Royal Enfield Taurus, introduced in 1993, holds the
                distinction of being India's first and only mass-produced diesel
                motorcycle. Powered by a 325cc air-cooled single-cylinder diesel
                engine, it produced 6.5 horsepower and 15 Nm of torque, mated to
                a 4-speed manual gearbox . Weighing 196 kg, it boasted
                impressive fuel efficiency, achieving around 80–90 km/l .
                However, its high vibrations, excessive noise, and black smoke
                emissions led to its discontinuation in 2000, as it couldn't
                meet evolving emission standards . Despite its brief production
                run, the Taurus remains a unique chapter in Royal Enfield's
                history.

                Ural motorcycles are rugged, all-terrain bikes with a
                distinctive sidecar configuration, powered by a 749cc or 806cc
                air-cooled, 2-cylinder, 4-stroke engine producing around 41-45
                horsepower. These motorcycles feature a 4-speed manual
                transmission with a reverse gear and are available in both 2WD
                and 1WD models, with the 2WD system engaging the sidecar wheel
                for enhanced traction on rough terrains. Their steel frame and
                independent suspension—telescopic forks at the front and
                hydraulic shock absorbers at the rear—offer durability and
                off-road capability. Ural bikes are equipped with drum brakes,
                with disc brake options available for improved stopping power.
